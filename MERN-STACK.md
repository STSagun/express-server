>The MERN stack consists of MongoDB, Express, React / Redux, and Node.js. Given the popularity of React on the frontend and of Node.js on the backend, the MERN stack is one of the most popular stack of technologies for building a modern single-page app.

Here’s a breakdown of the typical stack setup:

### MongoDB as a NoSQL database<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS5Sdpm5Q2hYAd20LewK3Z-QCXu0eIbPZ7EESQBbdzLbB9_Z_nS" height="30" width="30" align="left">
* An open source document database that provides persistence for application data.
* Bridges the gap between key-value stores (fast and scalable) and relational databases (rich functionality).
* Stores data as JSON documents in collections with dynamic schemas.
* Designed with scalability and developer agility in mind.
* Designed to be used asynchronously thus it pairs well with Node.js applications.

### Express web framework of Node.js provides routing and middleware<img src="https://d2eip9sf3oo6c2.cloudfront.net/tags/images/000/000/359/thumb/expressjslogo.png" height="30" width="30" align="left">

* Basically runs the backend code as a module within the Node.js environment.
* Handles the routing of requests to the right parts of your app.

### React.js provides a dynamic frontend <img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSc9qehbuh3jJsrsE83XLxbXY-86U8lt4dy8MFYlgp26WFOv4-q" height="30" width="30" align="left">

* A JavaScript library developed by Facebook to build interactive / reactive interfaces.

### Node.js on the server<img src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRXTk-C0O8AykhUIBuRcwgIZkyFycp158Y5yBv3y5wclUcHs-67Wg" height="30" width="30" align="left">

* A javascript runtime environment.
* An asynchronous event-driven engine - which means the app makes a request for some data and then performs other tasks while waiting for a response.

>The MERN stack wasn’t always the frontrunner in the JavaScript web app game. Many companies and developers still use the MEAN stack, which is identical to the MERN stack except it uses AngularJS or Angular instead of React for the frontend. _One of the distinguishing features from React_ is the **virtual DOM manipulation**, which helps keep apps dynamic and fast.
