3. Function Parameters
4. Markdown Preview
5. Integrated Version Control
####1. Huge Language Support
Not only is VS Code available cross-platform, it aims to be your one-stop code editor with support for **30+ programming languages out-of-the-box**. Which ones you ask? You get to write C#, VB, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Ruby, Objective-C, PHP, JSON, Less, Sass and Markdown, just to name a few. 

####2. Side-by-Side Editing
VS Code supports one of the most sought-after developer requests – editing code side by side. 
>The screenshot below shows two files from an  project being open for edits side by side – life is good.

####3. Function Parameters
One of the nifty _IntelliSense_ features of VS Code is helping out with typed function parameters during corresponding invocation, thus allowing easy code completion.
>As the screenshot below demonstrates, function invocation offers up typed parameters, if VS Code sees the function definition elsewhere in the project. Pretty slick.![ScreenShot](https://developer.telerik.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/ParameterHelp-1024x576.jpg)

####4. Markdown Preview
Most developers have their favorite Markdown editor – quickly type up Markdown and see the HTML preview. Well, VS Code has the intention to take over your Markdown edits, and has the goods to back the claim.

####5. Integrated Version Control
It would painful is developers had to step outside their code editor to accomplish version control tasks – so VS Code has Git integration built-in.
>You get a complete version control experience without having to ever leave VS Code.
